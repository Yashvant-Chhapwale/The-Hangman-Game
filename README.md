# The-Hangman-Game
A classic Hangman word-guessing game built with Python. Test your skills by uncovering the hidden word, one letter at a time, before you run out of chances. A fun project showcasing Python basics like loops, conditionals, and string manipulation!

### Caesar Cipher:
  - The `Caesar Cipher` is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
  - For example, with a shift of 3:
    - A becomes D
    - B becomes E
    - C becomes F
    - and so on ...    
  - The Caesar Cipher is considered a `symmetric key encryption method`. This means that the same key (i.e shift value) is used for both encryption and decryption.
  - `Encryption`: The sender uses a key (or shift value) to `encrypt` the message.
  - `Decryption`: The receiver uses the same key as the sender to `decrypt` the message back to its original form.

### Drawbacks:
  - **`No Complexity`:** The lack of complexity in the shifting process makes it vulnerable.
  - **`Lack Of Security`:** The security relies on the secrecy of the key, if someone knows the shift value, they can easily decrypt the message.
  - **`Plaintext Patterns`:** The structure of the plaintext (e.g., common letters, symbols, words and phrases) can be identified in the ciphertext, making it easier to decipher.

### Note:
  - The `Caesar Cipher` is usually designed for alphabetic characters, but it can be customized to accommodate numbers and symbols as well.

## Demonstration
  - Suppose, **`Key = 3`**
  - **`Message  = 'Hello World!'`**
  - Then, For **`Action = Encode`**:<br>
