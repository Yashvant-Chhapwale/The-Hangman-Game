### The_Hangman_Game:
  - The `Hangman Game` is a classic `Word-Guessing Game` where players try to reveal a hidden word by guessing its letters.
  - Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to `Hanging`, represented by a drawing or a countdown.
  - The Challenge is to guess the word correctly before running out of attempts.
  - **Rules**:
    - **Guess the Word:** A hidden word is displayed as blanks (_ _ _ _), and your goal is to guess the word by suggesting one letter at a time.
    - **Correct Guesses:** If you guess a correct letter, it is revealed in all its positions within the word.
    - **Incorrect Guesses:** Each incorrect guess brings you closer to "hanging," with a limited number of wrong attempts allowed.
    - **Winning or Losing:** Win by revealing the entire word before running out of attempts. Lose if you exceed the maximum number of wrong guesses.
